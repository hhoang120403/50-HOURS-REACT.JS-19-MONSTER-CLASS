Redux: is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the state of
an application in a predictable way. It is commonly used with libraries 
like React for building user interfaces but can be used with any 
JavaScript framework or library

  + A store is a central place where the state of our application is stored
and it can be created using the configureStore function, and it holds 
the entire state tree of our application.

  + A slice is a piece of store state and the corresponding reducer logic
to update the state. Slices are a way to organize our Redux store
by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

  + initialState: as the name suggest is going to be the "initial" data
of our state.

  + Reducers: they define how the information in a particular slice can
be changed or updated.

  + Actions: are like the request or commands you give to change a specific slice.

  + useSelector() Hook: allows us to read data from the redux store.

  + useDispatch() Hook: The dispatch function is used to send actions to
the store, triggering updates to the application state.
